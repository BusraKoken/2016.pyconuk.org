Hewlett Packard Enterprise actively participates in open source.  Thousands of
developers across the company are focused on open source projects, and HPE
sponsors and supports the open source community in a number of ways, including:
contributing code, sponsoring foundations and projects, providing active
leadership, and participating in various committees. We are committed to the
growth, maturity, and success of open source and contribute in a variety of
ways.  Whether contributing directly to projects, improving quality and
reliability for our products, increasing the support for open source projects,
or educating customers about the fear, uncertainty, and doubt spread by
opponents of open source, HPE focuses on enabling interoperability and reliable
consumption of open source in its products and across the open source
ecosystem.
