I am Emma, I am from Belgium and will be this year a second time PyCon UK attendee.
I have been involved in open-source at different levels for a bit more than a decade and, after a break of a few year am now back in the Python community.
One of the things I enjoy the most is not writing popular libraries or tools but rather sharing knowledge with others. And this is why I enjoy giving workshops and writing tutorials.
