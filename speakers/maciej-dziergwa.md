As a CEO of STX Next I lead a team of over 200 Python, mobile & front-end developers. I am responsible for executing the strategic direction and ongoing operations, growing Software House business worldwide. In the same time I realize my passion, I want to create workplaces for talented people and I want to deliver ready solutions and technologies to clients, which are necessary for developing their business. I’m inspired by Steven Covey’s “The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People” and the philosophy of “Win-win or No Deal.” I try to live this way in every aspect of my life.
