Floris wants to live in a world where everyone bottom-posts, cares
about security, loathes technical debt and develops using a test
driven approach.  As a Software Engineer, Pythonista, open source
contributor and Software Architect at cobe.io he has over 10 years
experience developing IT Operations Management solutions used in
diverse and demanding environments like investment banks and
telecommunications companies.

When heâ€™s not cutting code or whispering incantations over interesting
and industry leading technology, you can find him climbing up a
mountain, or paragliding down it.
