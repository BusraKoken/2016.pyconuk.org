I'm a scientist at heart with a love for tech. I was first introduced to Python six years ago during my Physics degree where we used it to build simulations. Since then, I've moved on to a more Computer Science focused education which exposed me to artificial intelligence algorithms, formal methods and cryptography. 
My motivation is to turn innovative ideas into reality. Recently, I have been working in Web Development which exposed me to a whole different variety of challenges and a new way of thinking about applications.
