Our vision is give young people opportunities to volunteer their digital skills in the community. We have been busy over the past 18 months helping
head teachers start after school coding clubs. The Digital Volunteers has recruited, trained and supported 15 volunteers. We have started 10 after school
coding clubs (6 in the more deprived areas of Torfaen and 4 in the more deprived areas of Newport) with on average 7.5 pupils attending each session. The children participate in creative learning and develop their computational thinking including problem solving, logic, decomposition, abstraction, collaboration, peer learning, knowledge sharing, crafting and self reflection.
