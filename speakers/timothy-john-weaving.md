I am at present a Mathematics student at Cardiff University, going into my second year. After discovering an interest in the application of Number Theory to such fields as digital security, I wrote a short paper on Eulerâ€™s Theorem and RSA Public Key Cryptography, for which I won a ticket to PyCon 2016.
As part of my research into the maths of RSA I explored the behaviour of Euler's "totient function" and was aided greatly by python in explaining the striking patterns which arose.
