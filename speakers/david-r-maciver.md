David R. MacIver is the primary author of the Hypothesis testing library, whose stated mission is "to drag the world kicking and screaming into a new and terrifying age of high quality software". As well as developing it, he also consults on its use and provides training.

Previously, he mostly worked in back end engineering and data processing at Google and a series of London startups, and was accused by a former CEO of not writing enough tests.
