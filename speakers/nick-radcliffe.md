I am the founder of Stochastic Solutions Limited, an Edinburgh company offering consulting and software in the area of predictive modelling and data analysis. I've been using Python for about a decade, mainly for data science. Over recent years, I've become interested in the area of test-driven data analysis, which seeks to apply TDD-inspired ideas to data analysis.

In addition to working Stochastic Solutions, I am a Visiting Professor in the Maths Department at Edinburgh University, in the Operations Research group.
