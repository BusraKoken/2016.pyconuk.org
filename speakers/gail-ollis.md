I have written software for many years, working on applications from radars and air traffic control to video effects and Java-powered cash registers. After twenty years as a professional programmer my long interest in the human element of programming practice finally won out and provoked a career break to study for a psychology degree.

I now teach programming for beginners at Bournemouth University, where I am  also working towards a PhD in the psychology of software development. I combine my computing experience and psychology skills to research the small-scale decisions programmers make on a daily basis and the effect these choices have on their peers.
