I am currently a rising Computer Science junior, studying in New Delhi (IN). I am also a part of Stanford's Crowd Research Collective (HCI dept at Stanford University) and interning at SquadRun, this summer. 
I am very passionate about learning programming and making others learn too. A keen FOSS enthusiast, I've interests in Data Science, Machine Learning and general concepts in AI, Human Computer Interaction and a strong knack in Design !

Recently, I organized my college's first hackathon: Hack@MSIT. I have been frequently giving a lot of open talks in his college, since I joined the college from first semester, on competitive programming, python programming, general web development, version control systems and open source tools/libraries.
