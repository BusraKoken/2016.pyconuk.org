Dr Andrew Robinson has used Python for almost everything. Since trying Python while developing cutting edge processor architectures during his PhD, he’s been hooked, using for the dull, to automate day to day system admin tasks, all the way up to ‘freezing time’ with his 48 camera Raspberry Pi based bullet time effect camera rig. As CEO of startup OpenLX his Python code powers interface products in systems around the world, ranging from keeping the lights on some major institutions, to controlling turnstiles and detecting leaks in the water network. A passionate advocate for computing education he’s written books about learning Python on Raspberry Pi, and more recently created CodeBug, the predecessor of the BBC Micro:bit. He’s currently working on how Python can make the transition from desktop to mobile and embedded devices.
