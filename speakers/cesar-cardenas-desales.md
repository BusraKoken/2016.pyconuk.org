I always enjoy a good programming riddle. I work mostly with Python, but have done unspeakable things in Java, Perl and PHP.

I've been doing Python for over a decade in projects covering the whole development stack, and speak Spanish, English and German.

I'm work for Zurich based Webrepublic AG, the leading Swiss digital marketing agency. I'm co-organizer of the Swiss Python Summit and the Zurich Python User Group.
