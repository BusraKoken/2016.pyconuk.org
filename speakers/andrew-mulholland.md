I am a 3rd year university student currently studying Computer Science in Belfast. In my free time I lead development on the free and open source PiNet project, while also leading the Northern Ireland Raspberry Jam. On top of this, I work to inspire hundreds of schoolkids up and down to consider Computer Science by giving them the opportunity to try it out in a fun way.
