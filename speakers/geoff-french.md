I am a research associate at the University of East Anglia  working on the use of deep learning and computer vision for environmental monitoring.

I took an interest in computer vision and machine learning when I took on a contract project concerning the automated processing of microscopy images; I ended up using texture segmentation. Subsequently, I took a year-long RA position at the University of East Anglia with a view to automatically processing videos of fishing trawler discards. I successfully used deep learning to handle this task. Since then I have kept a keen eye on the developments in the field and I continue to experiment frequently.
