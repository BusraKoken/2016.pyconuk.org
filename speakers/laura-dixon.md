I have taught Computer Science for the past ten years at Rugby School and the Royal High School, Bath, and before training as a teacher I worked as a PHP developer. I wrote the A Level Computer Science e-book for Cambridge Press and recorded content for OCR and University of Warwick MOOCs. I am interested in investigating new ways of learning about Computer Science and improving the delivery and perception of education in this field. I founded the CAS #include project which aims to challenge stereotypes and improve the diversity of students studying Computing in the UK.
