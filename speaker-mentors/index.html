                <h2>Speaker mentors at PyCon UK</h2>

<p>For first-time speakers, non-native English speakers, unconfident or uncertain speakers or simply anyone who’d like some help with a talk - here are some people who’d like to help you.</p>

<p>Speaking in front of a large audience doesn’t come easily to many people. Our conference
audiences are full of <em>interesting people with interesting things to say</em>. We want more of
them to to feel confident enough to submit a talk proposal.</p>

<p>We know those people exist, because we meet them at every event, and it’s always a shame to discover that someone had an interesting talk in them but kept it there.</p>

<h3>How the programme works</h3>
<p>To help more people feel comfortable taking the step to submit a talk, we have a <strong>speaker mentor programme</strong>. A speaker mentor is an experienced speaker, who has volunteered to help other speakers.</p>

<p>It could be any kind of help, for any kind of reason: anything from someone who can advise on whether your idea for a talk is a good one to someone who’ll be happy to hear you practise it; even someone who’ll agree to be the session chair for your talk at the event. You tell us what kind of help you’d like.</p>

<p>And it could be because you’re not confident about your English, because you’re a nervous speaker, because you’ve never done a talk before - it doesn’t matter why, the point is that if you’d like help, we can put you in touch with someone suitable to help you.</p>

<p>If you’d particularly like a speaker mentor who’s familiar with a particular subject, who speaks your native language, a female mentor - again, just tell us what will help you.</p>

<p><strong>Remember, we don’t want to be proud because we had a lot of superstar speakers at our conference. We want to be proud because we were the conference where you began your superstar speaking career.</strong></p>
