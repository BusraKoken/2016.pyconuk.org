We’re delighted to announce the launch of PyCon UK 2016!

The conference will run from 15th-19th September at [Cardiff City Hall](http://www.cardiffcityhall.com/), with a programme of talks, workshops, and other events aimed at the whole Python community.

More details are on the conference website, where you can [buy a ticket](/tickets/) or [submit a proposal](/cfp/) for a talk or a workshop.

We have worked hard to ensure the conference is more affordable than recent years. Tickets start at £96 for the weekend, and we are offering [financial assistance](/financial-aid/) to help people who would struggle to afford a ticket or other expenses.

The website’s code is on [GitHub](https://github.com/pyconuk/2016.pyconuk.org). If you find any problems, please submit an issue or a pull request.

If you run a local user group, please share this email with your members.

We look forward to seeing you in Cardiff in September!
