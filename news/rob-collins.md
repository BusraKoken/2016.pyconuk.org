We were dismayed today to hear news of the health of Rob Collins, who is very seriously ill in hospital and is not
expected to recover.

Rob has been a familiar and friendly face at PyCon UK and other events for several years. He was active in the Python
community, and was behind various initiatives - such as the well-loved EuroPython massages, which continued this year
in his absence, organising a card-signing for John Pinner when John was ill - and of course he was also known for his
talks, which were always insightful and often hilarious.

Rob's generous spirit was appreciated and valued very much in our community. On behalf of everyone in the Python world,
we extend Rob our thanks for his many contributions over the years, and for being a good friend who will be missed.

We're collecting reminiscences and messages of support for Rob. If you have anything you would like to share, please
send them to pyconukorganisers@gmail.com by the end of Saturday.

Our thoughts are with Rob and his family and close friends.
