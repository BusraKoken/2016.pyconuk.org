On Saturday 17th September, we're hosting a fun-packed day of activities and
workshops for children to learn all about getting the most out of the world
with Python.

We're working with the Raspberry Pi Foundation, and some of the team who
brought Python to the Micro:bit will be coming along to show you how use Python
to write games. There'll be a chance to play with robots, and to learn how to
program Minecraft with Python!

Tickets for children cost Â£5, and include lunch.
