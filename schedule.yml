# This YAML file contains a schedule for the Friday, Saturday, and Sunday of
# the conference, excluding the childrens' day activities.
#
# The parseschedule management command turns the data in this schedule into
# serialized ScheduleSlot objects in the schedule directory.  You will need to
# run that command every time you make changes to this file.
#
# The structure of the serialized object is a triply-nested dictionary.  The
# innermost values are either strings representing titles of sessions, or the
# keys of Session objects.
#
# If a session is held in several rooms and/or over several time slots, the
# session must be present in each time slot in the YAML below.
#
# Take a look at pycon.views.schedule_view to see how this data is used.
