        <p>For the first time, PyCon UK will open with a whole day of activities with the theme of <em>Introduction</em> , especially for
the benefit of newcomers to Python or to PyCons.</p>
<h2>It's for...</h2>
<h3>Beginners</h3>
<p>We'll have workshops on a variety of topics, and talks suitable for those new to programming. The day will help give
newcomers a head start, and make the following days' talks and activities more useful and accessible to them.</p>
<p>If you've ever felt that a PyCon might be fun but that you weren't expert enough to attend - this day is guaranteed
to show why that's not the case.</p>
<h3>... and non-beginners</h3>
<p>It's not just for beginners to programming; we'll also have sessions aimed at introducing new packages and techniques
to experienced programmers, and opportunities for those who want to get new initiatives started.</p>
<h2>Sessions</h2>
<p>We have some plans already, but of course we need your suggestions too. If you have a proposal for an activity that
you think would be suitable for the Introduction day, please <a href="/cfp">tell us all about it</a>. Be imaginative!</p>
<p>If you have a sprint or advanced workshop planned for Monday, a session on Thursday could be a good way of getting
newcomers started and ready.</p>
<h3>Workshops</h3>
<p>We plan to run:</p>
<ul>
<li>a Django Girls workshop</li>
<li>introductory Python tutorials</li>
<li>installation clinics</li>
<li>a CV clinic with a friendly recruiter</li>
<li>... and no doubt, <a href="/cfp">some brilliant ideas that haven't even been suggested to us yet</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Talks</h3>
<p>We'll have talks on a variety of subjects - <a href="/cfp">perhaps yours too?</a></p>
<h3>And also...</h3>
<p>New things often get started at conferences - projects, initiatives, movements. It's our experience that giving people
a chance to think and talk about something for two or three days before coming back together in earnest for some more
concerted efforts helps the idea gather momentum and pays dividends. A meeting or gathering on Thursday would be an
excellent opportunity to propose your new idea. All you need to do is <a href="/cfp">tell us about your suggestion</a>.</p>
<h2>Help out!</h2>
<p>Your experience, insight, patience, empathy and hard-won successes will be of enormous value at the Introduction day.
Please share them - as a helper in a workshop, by giving a talk, by running a clinic, or something else entirely. We
don't always get the chance to enjoy helping new people take some of the most rewarding and exciting steps in
programming - so here's an opportunity to be reminded of just how much fun it can to be a part of it. <a href="/cfp">How would you
like to help?</a></p>
