For the first time, PyCon UK will begin with an Open Day: a whole day of of activities especially for the benefit of
newcomers to Python.

Entrance is free and open to everyone, but you'll need to tell us you're coming, even if you've already got a ticket for the main conferece.

<tito-widget event="pyconuk/2016" releases="k4gmkzn7djq">Visit [our ticket page on Tito](https://ti.to/pyconuk/2016/with/k4gmkzn7djq) if you donâ€™t see a ticket form</tito-widget>.


## It's for...

### Beginners

We'll have workshops on a variety of topics, and talks suitable for those new to programming. The day will help give
newcomers a head start, and make the following days' talks and activities more useful and accessible to them.

If you've ever felt that a PyCon might be fun but that you weren't expert enough to attend - this day is guaranteed
to show why that's not the case.

### ... and non-beginners

It's not just for beginners to programming; we'll also have sessions aimed at introducing new packages and techniques
to experienced programmers, and opportunities for those who want to get new initiatives started.

## What's on

* introductory (and fun and informative) talks aimed at a wide audience - see the [Programme](/programme) page for more details
* [Django Girls workshop](https://djangogirls.org/pyconuk2016/)
* introductory Python tutorials
* installation clinics
* a CV clinic with a friendly recruiter
* ... and no doubt, [some brilliant ideas that haven't even been suggested to us yet](/cfp)


### And also...

New things often get started at conferences - projects, initiatives, movements. It's our experience that giving people
a chance to think and talk about something for two or three days before coming back together in earnest for some more
concerted efforts helps the idea gather momentum and pays dividends. A meeting or gathering on Thursday would be an
excellent opportunity to propose your new idea. All you need to do is [tell us about your suggestion](/cfp).

## Help out!

Your experience, insight, patience, empathy and hard-won successes will be of enormous value at the Open Day.
Please share them - as a helper in a workshop, by giving a talk, by running a clinic, or something else entirely. We
don't always get the chance to enjoy helping new people take some of the most rewarding and exciting steps in
programming - so here's an opportunity to be reminded of just how much fun it can to be a part of it. [How would you
like to help?](/cfp)
