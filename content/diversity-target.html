<h2>Our diversity target</h2>

<p>We want this year's PyCon audience to be the most diverse ever, and the conference to represent the diversity of their experiences and interests.</p>

<p>To help us achieve this, we have set ourselves some aims, and one very clear and simple target.</p>

<p>It's notable how few women there are typically in attendance at a software conference. It's not just women who are sorely under-represented at software events, it's also non-white people, older people, disabled people and other groups too.</p>

<p>There are many metrics for diversity, but in the interests of simplicity and practicality as far as targets and recorded numbers are concerned, at this event we'll be focusing particularly on the gender balance of our audience and speakers.</p>

<h3>Speaker diversity</h3>

<p>At last year's event, <strong>fewer than 20%</strong> of our speakers were women. That's even even lower than the proportion of women MPs in the House of Commons.</p>

<p>It doesn't have to be this way. Our target at this PyCon is to receive at least **one-third of our talk proposals from women**, and a substantial improvement generally in the representation of other PyCon minorities amongst the talk applicants.</p>

<p>This is not impossible to achieve, by any means.</p>

<h4>PyCon US</h4>

<ul>
<li>2011: about 1% of speakers were women</li>
<li>2014 and 2015: about one-third were women</li>
</ul>

<h4>DjangoCon Europe</h4>

<ul>
<li>2014: two our of 32 speakers were women</li>
<li>2105: approximately one-third of speakers were women</li>
<li>2016: approximately one-half of speakers are women</li>
</ul>

<p>(It's less easy to put numbers to other under-represented groups.)</p>

<h3>How we intend to meet this target</h3>

<p>To achieve the numbers we're aiming for, we will encourage people in under-represented groups to submit more talks.</p>

<p>This will involve a number of different initiatives and strategies, that have proved successful in at other events. To begin with, you can read more about our <a href="/diversity-accessibility-inclusion">diversity and accessibility policies</a>.</p>

<p>We will be monitoring our own progress, and reporting on it.</p>

<p>In the meantime, if you're a Python user who's in one of the many groups that are not well-represented at our PyCons, we particularly want to hear from you, and we urge you to consider <a href="/cfp">submitting a proposal</a> for a talk, workshop or other activity.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
