## Hotels

### Recommended partner hotels

#### Royal Hotel

The [Royal Hotel](http://www.royalhotelcardiff.com) is perfectly-placed, mid-way between City Hall (about 10 minutes'
walk) and Cardiff Central Railway station.

Please use the code *PyCon* when booking, using the [Royal Hotel booking

include breakfast, in a double or twin room.

* Example rate: five nights for two people, including breakfast: £182.50 each

#### Other recommended hotels

We're negotiating with several local hotels to provide preferential rates for attendees. As we make these arrangements,
we'll list them here, along with codes you might need to secure a discount. **We hope to have a complete list by Friday
6th May.**

In the meantime...

### Other hotels

Check sites such as [Hotels.com](http://hotels.com) and [Booking.com](http://booking.com) for other hotels. (Apparently
if you put your browser into private or incognito mode, you can sometimes get different, better, prices. Who knows?)

Some hotels don’t even appear on those sites, never mind offer discounts to Pythonistas; you need to go to their
websites directly and pay the same as everyone else.

#### Travelodge Hotels

There are several [Travelodge hotels](https://www.travelodge.co.uk) in Cardiff, including one very close to City Hall
and one very close to Cardiff Central Railway station.

#### Premier Inn

There's a [Premier Inn](http://www.premierinn.com/) on Churchill Way, about ten minutes' walk from City Hall.

## Alternatives

There are hotels and guest-houses along Cathedral Road, a not unpleasant (this can depend upon what the weather
has to offer) walk away from City Hall through Bute Park.

Consult [Wimdu](http://www.wimdu.com/) and [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.co.uk/).

## Get the location right

You’ll have most fun at PyCon if you’re staying somewhere a short walk from City Hall. Here's a [handy map of hotels in
