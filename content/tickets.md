Tickets cost:

 * £96 if you are paying for your own ticket;
 * £144 if your employer is paying for your ticket.

Entrance to the Thursday is free of charge.

There are cheaper tickets if you can only come for some days, but we hope that you'll come for the whole conference!

[Financial aid](/financial-aid/) is available to help cover ticket costs for
those who would otherwise not be able to afford to attend the conference.
