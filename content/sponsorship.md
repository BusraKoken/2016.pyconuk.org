community, promote your products, and meet Python developers who are looking
for work.

We couldn't run the conference without the generous support of our sponsors.
In return, we will ensure that our your company is given exposure before,
during, and after the conference, and we will work with you so that you get
exactly you're looking for out of sponsoring the conference.
