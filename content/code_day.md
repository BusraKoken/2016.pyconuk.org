### Workshops

During the talks you'll have heard about numerous projects and technologies that you'd like to get involved in. Several
of the speakers will also be running hands-on, practical tutorials for those who'd like to explore the topic further.

These sessions will cover all kinds of things - particular packages, programming disciplines, techniques. In previous
years we've had workshops on Django, automated testing, how to contribute to open-source projects, mathematics,
robotics and much, much more.

Would you like to run a workshop? [Tell us about it!](/cfp)

### Sprints

Code sprints provide members of an open-source software community opportunities to collaborate in person to tackle
outstanding issues or developments in a projectâ€™s code-base, or even to get a fledgling project started. They are huge
fun, and a fantastic way to become involved in a new project.

Newcomers are welcome at sprints - so don't think they're only for so-called 'experts'.

You don't need to plan a sprint in advance, but if you [tell us about your sprint](/cfp) we can help advertise it for
you.

If you've got this far but still aren't sure what a sprint is, you should read [What on earth is a code sprint?](/what-are-sprints).

### Clinics

Take your sickly code to the friendly PyCon UK code doctor. Take your CV to a recruitment expert.

Would you like to perform a valuable PyCon UK service by running or taking part in a clinic? [Tell us what you'd like
to do.](/cfp)

### Other collaboration

Do you have a big idea, that needs some other fine minds to help get it off the ground?

Are you planning your own conference, or meetup, or organisation?

Are you seeking collaborators?

There's a good chance you'll find what you're looking for at PyCon UK. [Tell us about your proposal or idea.](/cfp)
