We're delighted to announce our first keynote speaker, [Gail
Ollis](http://staffprofiles.bournemouth.ac.uk/display/gollis).

Gail is not just a programmer, she's also an observer of programmers - of the way they work, think and behave. So, her interest in programming includes the *activity* of programming.

Her publications and research work are full of observations and insights into the mind of the programmer, and draw upon
a wide range of references to help illuminate what goes on when programmers get to work.

Her talk for us at this year's PyCon UK:

> **Folklore and fantasy in the information age**

> Software development is not easy.

> As grown-ups we know better than to believe that difficult things can be achieved
> by a simple wave of a magic wand, yet faith persists that this new idea, that new tool, will make all the
> difference.
>
> Meanwhile for the hard-bitten cynics it is all the emperor's new clothes. I invite you to join me in a
> more constructive realm between belief and cynicism, where we can embrace the power of stories, listen with an open
> mind, but not be bewitched by the expectation of a fairy-tale ending.

This talk is one not to be missed by the reflective programmer.
