<p>
    PyCon UK has a reputation as a friendly, welcoming, and safe conference.
    It should go without saying that we expect everybody who takes part in the
    conference to treat each other with respect.
</p>

<p>
    For clarity about what we expect, the conference has a code of conduct,
    which will be available here before the conference is launched.
