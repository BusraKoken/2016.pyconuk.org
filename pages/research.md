## Python for researchers

If you are a working scientist, data scientist, digital humanities scholar or artist, then this part of the conference is just for you.

Whether you have never used Python before and want to dip your toe in the water, or you are a fully-fledged Pythonista looking to expand your repertoire, the **Code4Research** theme will offer you three days of learning, collaboration and fun, and a chance to meet other researchers using Python.

Now in its second year, the Code4Research theme will give you the chance to meet with and learn from fellow researchers and professional developers.

Last year we were joined by Python programmers (and some non-programmers) from fields as diverse as mathematics, nuclear fusion and the digital humanities. You can read more about
[the fun we had, and why the 2015 delegates chose the theme name *Code4Research* ](http://www.software.ac.uk/blog/2015-09-30-event-research-software-engineers-starts-and-ends-bang-pycon-uk).

Code4Research will run from Saturday 17th September to Monday 19th:
[Book now](/tickets/), [propose a session](/cfp/) or learn about [sponsorship opportunities](/sponsorship/).
We are very keen to attract early career researchers, including MSc and PhD students, who should apply for [financial aid](/financial-aid/).

### Tickets

There are cheaper tickets if you can only come for some days, but we hope that you'll come for the whole conference!
