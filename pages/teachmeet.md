If you’ve never been to a Teachmeet before, they are informal events all about creating opportunities for those interested in education to take the lead, share practice, discover new ideas, network and be inspired! Anyone can get involved, share great ideas they've trialled in their classrooms, share their research, ask important questions or come by to take part in learning conversations.

What’s really important about Teachmeets is that all the ideas come from colleagues who are working with children. They know it works because they do it everyday! And who would be better to learn from and share ideas with? We’re not talking about groundbreaking - but one simple 10 minute activity your class love, could make the world of difference to someone else really struggling to teach that topic or even just as another resource to add to the ideas bank.

These events only work by people generously agreeing to give up their time to share their ideas and practice and if you’re prepared to do this you can choose between a 3 minute and 8 minute presentation. Presentations are informal, they do not need slides (although if you want slides, that’s ok too!) and can be everything from you sharing class projects, to just talking about a lesson that went really well. The audience are fellow teachers, so it’s a really easy crowd and everyone will be really supportive!

If you do want to present, please let us know so we can sort out a timetable of speakers! [You can do that here](https://goo.gl/forms/NZaQrNGK3DhYqhnD2)
