Our day for children is back!

We're hosting a fun-packed day of activities and workshops for children to
learn all about getting the most out of the world with Python.

We're working with the Raspberry Pi Foundation, and some of the team who
brought Python to the Micro:bit will be coming along to show you how use Python
to write games.  There'll be a chance to play with robots, and to learn how to
program Minecraft with Python!

It doesn't matter if you've never programmed a computer before!  We'll have
lots of volunteers on hand to show you what you need to know.
