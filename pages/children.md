Our day for children is back!

We're hosting a fun-packed day of activities and workshops for children to
learn all about getting the most out of the world with Python.

We're working with the Raspberry Pi Foundation, and some of the team who
brought Python to the Micro:bit will be coming along to show you how use Python
to write games.  There'll be a chance to play with robots, and to learn how to
program Minecraft with Python!

It doesn't matter if you've never programmed a computer before!  We'll have
lots of volunteers on hand to show you what you need to know.

## Activities

### Intro to Python with Code Club Projects

### Do something else in Python...

Take Python programming beyond the screen and control real world physical
objects. A session for children already comfortable with Python basics.

Get your first taste of programming the world of Minecraft using Python. Great
for those new to Python programming.

Want to be a games developer? Then use your Python skills to make your very own
game.

### BBC micro:bit Mayhem

Bring your BBC micro:bit along or play with one of ours to create a TARDIS or
control Minecraft! Fun for kids and adults.

### Python for Parents

Because you have no idea what just happened but now your kids are enthusiastic
and keep asking questions...
