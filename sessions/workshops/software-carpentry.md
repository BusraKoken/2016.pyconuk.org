Software Carpentry teaches researchers in science, engineering, medicine, and related disciplines the computing skills they need to get more done in less time and with less pain. In this hands-on session, you will learn how to load, manipulate, analyse and plot data with Python. We will teach you the best practices to make sure your work is robust, automated and reproducible. There are no pre-requisites, and we will assume no prior knowledge about the tools.
