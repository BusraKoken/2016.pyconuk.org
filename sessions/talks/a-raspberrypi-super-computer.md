The idea is to create from all the Raspberry Pi's that people bring to the sprint a super computer. Yes this has been done already in a number of cases but they were usually specialized system: the idea here is to make an ad hoc cluster on which jobs can be run. Maybe getting MPI to run is Stage 1, there will also be a controller needed that accepts and schedules jobs (probably best run on a controlling laptop). The "hidden" agenda here is to make something that could be recreated in schools and/or colleges so as to give a fun platform for playing with simple ideas of concurrency and parallelism. The hidden agenda is to try and get introduction to concurrency and parallelism moved from final year university options to schools. Obviously not the detailed stuff but just enough to stop people feeling lost. Another "hidden" agenda is to get people working in a polyglot way: Python with other languages.
