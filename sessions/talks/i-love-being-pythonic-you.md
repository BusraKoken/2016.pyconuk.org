The Python programming language usage in our profession is increasing a lot day by day in any kind of area which is very exciting to a python developer. Python is executable pseudo code. It is super easy to get started but when the code grows, some adjustments are going to be required. It has unique strengths
and charms that can be hard to grasp. Programmers familiar with other languages may try to write Python as if it’s C++, Java, or whatever they know best. It’s important for everyone to know—the Pythonic—way to do the most common things in Python. Python philosophy suggests to be explicit, to choose simple over complex, and to maximise readability.

In this talk, I am going to share what Pythonic thinking means, which kind of cases there are to be given as examples. I am going to share the experience that I have been gaining by coding Python as a person having a C-family languages background. The more you learn the strength of python language the more you enjoy coding.
